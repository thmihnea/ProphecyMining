# ProphecyMining
A plugin which hooks into a database and keeps track of the ores a player mines, his level/experience while mining and the coins gathered through mining. Also adds a variety of new enchantments to the game and provides an intricate system which allows the rollback of ores/stones (regeneration of mineable blocks in set areas using the /sbregion command).
